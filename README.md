Please check [here](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-for-node/) for detail. I forked this repository from there, and make some changes to make it work with the latest node.js version, which is 0.6.4.

After the changes, I have successfully made compile on Mac OS X 10.7. More tests need to be done on other linux platforms.
